# Telegram Bot

Telegram bot to store movies information lol idk what to write here, I just want to know if I can make a bot.

# What's New

### v0.2.0

- Added `!delete` command, so user commands, and bot's replies to those commands older than a certain specified limit (1 day) are deleted, maintained by using a table called `delete-queue`.
- `!notify` now sends DMs to subscribers, provided they have enabled talking to the bot
- Removed _unnecessary_ commands from the source.
- Cool.

[see here](./changelog.md) the full changelog.
