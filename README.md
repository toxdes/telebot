# Telegram Bot

Telegram bot to store movies information lol idk what to write here, I just want to know if I can make a bot.

# What's New
### v 0.3.4
- For `!delete`, changed interval from 1 day to 5 minutes
- Added `jest` for unit testing, but only a few tests are currently added to the test suite
- Finished implementing `!deletecmd` command.
- Added more fields to commands table to handle command aliases in a better way.

### v 0.3.0
- Added functionality for user to add commands. So, the commands are now classified in two categories, one is core commands, and other is user commands. 
- To manage user commands, `!addcmd`, `!alias`, `!updatecmd` and `!deletecmd` are added. 
- `!deletecmd` is not yet implemented. Also a lot of testing is remaining. 
- Upgraded `pg` dependancy to latest version, so this setup works with `node 14`
  
### v0.2.1

- Updated version for `package.json`, minor fixes.
- Added `!delete` command, so user commands, and bot's replies to those commands older than a certain specified limit (5 minutes) are deleted, maintained by using a table called `delete-queue`.
- `!notify` now sends DMs to subscribers, provided they have enabled talking to the bot
- Removed _unnecessary_ commands from the source.
- Cool.
