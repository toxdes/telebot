```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/toxdes/telebot.git
$ cd telebot
# populate config.sh with appropriate values
# alternatively you can set environment variables yourself
$ source config.sh
$ npm start # start the server
```

2. Provide all of the fields in `config.sh`.

| Sr. No. | Field                         | Title                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|   1.    | `BOT_TOKEN`                   | [Bot Token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)  | _This step is done in the telegram app._ A typical bot token looks like `110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw`.                                                                                                                                                      |
|   2.    | `BOT_USERNAME`                | Telegram Bot Username                                    | Grab the username that you chose while creating a bot in step 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   3.    | `BOT_USERID`                  | Bot User ID                                              | It is usually the number on the left of `:` in the bot token. For our example, Bot User ID is `110201543`.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|   4.    | `CHANNEL_USERNAME`            | Channel Username (for archiving messages)                | _This step is done in the telegram app_.Create a new channel, add the bot created in step 1. to this channel, and give it administrative rights, so it can post messages in it.                                                                                              | Grab the channel username. |
|   5.    | `DATABASE_URL`                | [Postgres Database URL](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) | We use postgresql to manage a privilige based user system, so only intended commands are visible to each user. And we also need to store the movie ratings as well, so, we need a database. Heroku has a free tier, which is enough for the most part :p.                    |
|   6.    | `DEV_DATABASE_URL` (optional) | Development Database URL                                 | It's easier to manage the bot if the development and production environments have different databases, so you can just create a new database instance (which is free on heroku) and grab its URL.Don't worry about this step if you don't intend to test / develop this bot. |

# What's New

### v0.3.4

- For `!delete`, changed interval from 1 day to 5 minutes
- Added `jest` for unit testing, but only a few tests are currently added to the test suite
- Finished implementing `!deletecmd` command.
- Added more fields to commands table to handle command aliases in a better way.

### v0.3.0

- Added functionality for user to add commands. So, the commands are now classified in two categories, one is core commands, and other is user commands.
- To manage user commands, `!addcmd`, `!alias`, `!updatecmd` and `!deletecmd` are added.
- `!deletecmd` is not yet implemented. Also a lot of testing is remaining.
- Upgraded `pg` dependancy to latest version, so this setup works with `node 14`

### v0.2.1

- Updated version for `package.json`, minor fixes.
- Added `!delete` command, so user commands, and bot's replies to those commands older than a certain specified limit (5 minutes) are deleted, maintained by using a table called `delete-queue`.
- `!notify` now sends DMs to subscribers, provided they have enabled talking to the bot
- Removed _unnecessary_ commands from the source.
- Cool.
