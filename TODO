Now:
  ■ learning how to maintain two branches, one master and other develop.
    this stuff is so difficult.
    I'm now doing this changes in develop. But suppose they are not good enough to be merged into master yet, so I will stage and commit this, and will do `yarn git`.
    what I'm expecting to happen is master remains unchanged and develop branch should be one commit ahead. Otherwise three commits ahead. 
    I'm not even going to checkout master, push right away from develop. 
Future:
  ■ Work on `!rate`
    ■ add `!trust` command
      1. create a new field for subscribers table, named `is_trusted` and `trusted_by`.
      2. command will have god privilige and will be a reply to a message, if already trusted it toggles  it.
      3. Each rating will be recorded, but the movie's rating will reflect only with the trusted users.
      4. Once the user is trusted, maybe the movie's rating can be updated with changes.
    ■ should have alter table query to alter columns of tables
      because the test and production databases are different
    ■ figure out proper format of the movie's details
      1. shold the process be automated?
      2. categories with hashtags, rating from IMDb, maybe through API or through a bot.
      3. easily searchable with commands such as `!search [movie/category]`, `!giveme` etc.
      4. also try out interactive messaging, with gods, like the spotify bot does?
      ■ rating algorithm for calculating both user's rating, and movie's rating


  ■ `!help` command should only show relevant commands
    ■ currently everything just gets clogged up, if there are lot of commands.A lot of GOD level commands are not at all useful for USERs and NOBODY. So, show only those that are relevant.
    ■ Also, it might happen that user added commands are a lot. Maybe have a global message that stores, and is updated everytime the command is updated, and it should be DMd/redirected with a link to that global message to the user?
  
  ■ `!delete` shouldn't delete messages that might be relevant 
    For example, messages with `!notify`, `!suggest` etc are relevant for everyone, so they shouldn't be deleted.
    So, delete_queue check should have a exclude list for commands, and such commands should be excluded from `delete_queue`.
  ■ `!notify` command should send message-copy to the sender as well, just append that text.
  ■ Refactor Code, probably the `handle_command` and such things.
