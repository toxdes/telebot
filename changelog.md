Changelog for the development

### v0.1.0

- Added changelog, version set to 0.1.0 cause most commands work now.
- fixed `!sub` command, added hint for user to press start button, so that the bot can DM the users
- some people don't have usernames, for them using `first_name` as username, however, mentioning a user is working.
- some minor fixes that I can't think of.
